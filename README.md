# Inflation

These inflation calculators are live online at
https://inflation.cmprh.com/
.

Each calculator works in your browser,
or can be installed from the browser to your phone's home screen.

You can fork this repository to derive a calculator

- for another currency,
- for a currency and its predecessor, or
- to change its appearance.

One difficulty level up is to derive a calculator

- between currencies of countries.

The US inflation calculator has been configured for a single currency.
A historical currency switch is handled correctly in the Austria calculator,
as an example.
The code for multiple currencies is present in both calculators.
