# Inflation

This inflation calculator is live online at
https://inflation.cmprh.com/
.

This calculator works in your browser,
or can be installed from the browser to your phone's home screen.

It is optimized for certain uses.

You can fork this repository to derive a calculator

- for another currency,
- for a currency and its predecessor, or
- to change its appearance.

One difficulty level up is to derive a calculator

- between currencies, or
- for interest.

The `main` branch has been configured with a single currency.
The same code handling a historical currency switch is in use
on branch `inflation-at`, as an example.
The necessary code is in the main branch too.
